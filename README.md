# Development board for the ATtiny44A MCU

This is a simple board for experimenting with Microchip's ATtiny44A
8 bit microcontroller.

Main characteristics:

- Support for providing an external clock using a THT quartz.
- Decoupling of power pins.
- Correct termination of the /RESET pin.
- ICSP header.

A complete BOM is provided for [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/).

## Feedback

This is my first PCB design. I'd love to receive feedback and ideas for
improvements from more experienced people.

PR's and Issues are welcome!
